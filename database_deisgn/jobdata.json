We're building a future where retailers can eliminate the massive operational overhead and technical debt associated with online checkout and payments, and where customers can buy instantly and securely across the internet. To solve such a large problem, we've put together an incredible team and are selectively adding to it.\n\nPlay a mission-critical role in developing the future of online commerce. We are looking for a creative, passionate individual who love building great things. Companies and consumers alike will rely heavily on what you build. You’ll have a ton of trust and responsibility. So, if challenges excite you, and you’re ready for a big one, let us know.\n\nAs a New Grad Software Engineer, you will work in a fast paced engineering team.

If we are making no mistakes, it means, quite simply, that we’re not moving fast enough. We also believe that mistakes are the primary means of learning. At Bolt, a 20% error rate is not only permissible, but expected.\n\nBe Fearless\n\nFear is the primary motivator of human action. It drives people to seek safety and complacency, causing aversion to risk and change. However, it’s risk and change that advances the human race. We believe that risk and change are required to transform digital commerce.\n\nChase 10x, Not 10%\n\nThe only way a startup can outcompete corporations with 100x employees is by leveraging its force multipliers of talent, ambition, and creativity. Large corporations focus on 10% optimizations to generate millions in revenue. As a startup, we must consistently chase the 10x opportunities.\n\nAll or Nothing\n\nWe’re not here to advance our professional careers or for a financial outcome. We’re here because we’re obsessed with changing the world and becoming the best versions of ourselves. And we trust that, if we are true to our obsession, everything else will fall into place. This obsession drives us to make “All or Nothing” decisions about who we hire or what problem we tackle.\n\nKeep it Simple\n\nWorship of complexity has drowned the modern world. Simple solutions are harder to come by, but they are worth their weight in gold. Simplicity enables speed, reduces cost, and allows for faster learning.\n\nWin as a Team\n\nAt Bolt, we want everyone to be successful in their pursuits. We know that our peers’ successes are tied to ours. And their triumphs, whether personal, professional, or otherwise, will benefit the company and us as individuals in the long term.\n\nBolt is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

What is the best developer experience for making payments? How do you balance API versioning while keeping changes fast? How do you build an API generic enough for any marketplace while still being simple?\nHere are some past projects by your fellow new grads:\n Analyzing how much of a negative balance each merchant should be able to hold. Too much and Stripe runs a risk of fraud, too little and it impacts merchant operations. Bundling Tax and Shipping costs into a charge flow in a simple and intuitive manner. Allowing merchants to give granular permissions to different users of their business. At a big company, the CFO shouldn’t be making API calls nor should an engineer be accidentally actioning disputes. Shipping Stripe to more countries and payment mechanisms (did you know there are > 100 ways to pay in the world?) \nEngineering at Stripe\n\nA core part of our engineering culture is inclusiveness: we want to accommodate people from all backgrounds and walks of life.\n\nWe believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don’t necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it’s their job to make sure all the work gets done.\n\nWe launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. (The first version of Stripe, for example, had a beta user since the time we could literally only charge a credit card—we couldn’t even pay out those charges!) This helps ensure that we’re building what users actually want.\n\nWe contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.\n\nOur shipping culture How we recruit Guide to the onsite interview (PDF)\n\nTeams at Stripe\n\nRather than adopting extreme models of “horizontal” teams oriented around technologies (a web team, a platform team, etc.) or “vertical” teams oriented around business goals (a revenue team), we pick and choose the parts we like about both models for our teams.\n\nOur “vertical” teams (Checkout, Ops, Product, and Risk) can operate independently, building the technology that they need to operate. Each one may not have deep expertise in every part of the stack, but they have enough that things can get done without blocking on other teams.\n\nOur “horizontal” teams (Data, Dev tools, Internal tools, Security, Sys) provide support to the others and have deeper expertise on particular parts of the stack. It’s their job to build platforms that are so good the other teams want to use them, rather than being forced into it.\n\nTeams at Stripe are relatively fluid. Some people stay on a given team for a handful of months, while others seem to prefer sticking to their team permanently. Once you join, we’ll work with you to choose a team to get started with—it’s all pretty flexible.\n\nStripe’s engineering challenges\n\nYou Should Include These In Your Application\n Links to online profiles you use (GitHub, Twitter, etc). A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose). \nIf there are teams you’d be particularly interested in working on, please let us know (and tell us why!).

Gene editing and cell therapy will dramatically change how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials will transform the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology will produce sustainable and ethical food. Benchling's mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this future, and magnify its impact, through modern software.\nEvery day, scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.\nBenchling was founded by a team of MIT graduates and has raised funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Y Combinator. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the world's most renowned research institutes.\nOur engineering team is small but growing. We're looking for engineers who thrive on teamwork, crave ownership and impact, and are driven to make a dent in our space.\n\nResponsibilities\n Work with and learn from a strong team of engineers hailing from MIT, CMU, Facebook, Stripe, and more. We grow our new grads through mentorship and ownership. Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout. Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows. Design and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.\nYOU\n Recently obtained or pursuing a BA/BS and/or MA/MS degree in computer science, math or a related technical field. Build software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code. Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback. Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product. Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).\nYOU MIGHT WORK ON\n\nHere Are Some Other Examples Of Recent And Future Projects\n\nCheck out our engineering blog for some examples of past work.\n Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues. Complex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser. A customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling. Data warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values. A new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.\nOUR VALUES\n Empower through information. We explain the \"why\" behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making. Rely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough. Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve. Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, \"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.\"\nPerks And Benefits\n Beautiful, light-filled office in the Financial District of SF Monthly health & wellness stipend Work with a talented yet humble team Meals and snacks covered 401k Medical, dental, and vision insurance Commuter benefits Happy hours, company and team wide social events\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

If we are making no mistakes, it means, quite simply, that we’re not moving fast enough. We also believe that mistakes are the primary means of learning. At Bolt, a 20% error rate is not only permissible, but expected.\n\nBe Fearless\n\nFear is the primary motivator of human action. It drives people to seek safety and complacency, causing aversion to risk and change. However, it’s risk and change that advances the human race. We believe that risk and change are required to transform digital commerce.\n\nChase 10x, Not 10%\n\nThe only way a startup can outcompete corporations with 100x employees is by leveraging its force multipliers of talent, ambition, and creativity. Large corporations focus on 10% optimizations to generate millions in revenue. As a startup, we must consistently chase the 10x opportunities.\n\nAll or Nothing\n\nWe’re not here to advance our professional careers or for a financial outcome. We’re here because we’re obsessed with changing the world and becoming the best versions of ourselves. And we trust that, if we are true to our obsession, everything else will fall into place. This obsession drives us to make “All or Nothing” decisions about who we hire or what problem we tackle.\n\nKeep it Simple\n\nWorship of complexity has drowned the modern world. Simple solutions are harder to come by, but they are worth their weight in gold. Simplicity enables speed, reduces cost, and allows for faster learning.\n\nWin as a Team\n\nAt Bolt, we want everyone to be successful in their pursuits. We know that our peers’ successes are tied to ours. And their triumphs, whether personal, professional, or otherwise, will benefit the company and us as individuals in the long term.\n\n Perks \n\nWork with a world-class teamSignificant equity at a fast-growing companyOwnership and autonomy over substantial projectsGenerous medical, dental and vision benefits for you and your familyParental leaveDaily breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a fully stocked kitchenFlexible vacation policyParking and transit benefits, including safe and last mile rides401(k)Relocation supportAn office filled with energy and optimism\n\nBolt is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace.

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.\n\nThe Role\n\nForward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” FDSEs lead the process of finding answers.\n\nAs an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. Like at a startup, you'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll have a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend.\n\nYou'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you're ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.\n\nFor Example, We Currently Use\n\nWith Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly. We often face entirely novel problems, so solving them may require expanding your skillset.\n\n A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github\n\nAnd if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.\n\nA career as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could.

Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nWe're creating a repository for all human knowledge. To do that, we need to design systems that make sharing knowledge rewarding and discovering it easy; that show you answers to questions you didn't know you had, on topics you didn't know you liked; and that scale to support the participation of the entire planet. Designing a global ecosystem for knowledge sharing requires a multidisciplinary approach and a diverse team, empowered to shape strategy while moving quickly and learning as much as possible.\n\nQuora designers are thoughtful generalists. As a product designer, you'll be responsible for what you design from start to finish: brainstorming solutions, iterating on visuals and interactions however you see fit, and finally implementing your designs in code yourself (no middlemen required!). You work on everything from ranking to UI, from internationalization to moderation systems. Your design decisions are validated through A/B testing and user studies alike, as we value rigor and empathy in equal measure.\n\nResponsibilities\n Work on a product team focused on a major, user-facing area of Quora. Identify high-impact opportunities, design features in pursuit of goals, and explain the rationale for your decisions Collaborate with engineers to define features and functionality, with other designers for feedback and critique, and with data scientists and user researchers to evaluate the impact of your work Design interactions for new features, applying existing design patterns and creating new ones, across our platforms Build what you design using a custom web framework developed by Quora that makes front-end development easy and efficient. Designers at Quora code  Work quickly and effectively on multiple projects. Ship new features, bug fixes, and small improvements multiple times a week  Minimum Qualifications:\n A portfolio demonstrating relevant design capabilities is required. Applications without portfolios will not be considered Technical competence with front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript Ability to think at a high level about a complex, social product, and to clearly explain reasons for new features and changes Experience building clear, effective interactions to accomplish product or business goals Demonstrated visual design skill, especially in the construction of visual hierarchies, and attention to detail on typography, spacing, and color Interest in using data and user research to inform design decisions A passion for learning and always improving yourself and the team around you  Preferred Qualifications:\n Experience with server-side languages like Python Experience with effective A/B testing Interest or experience in designing for ads, mobile, or user growth Passion for Quora's mission and goals \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\n ",

Like at a startup, you'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll have a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend.\n\nYou'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping.

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. The Role Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like \"Why has our assembly line slowed down?\" or \"How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?\" FDSEs lead the process of finding answers. As an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. Like at a startup, you'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll have a large company behind you - namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend. You'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you're ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products. With Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly. We often face entirely novel problems, so solving them may require expanding your skillset. For example, we currently use: A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github And if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it. A career as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could. As you rotate among teams, you'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, finance, and law enforcement. You'll learn from experts in these fields about their problems and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them. Questions that seem simple from the outside will quickly become complex as you consider the nuances and consequences of every possible answer.

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.\n\nThe Role\n\nForward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” FDSEs lead the process of finding answers.\n\nAs an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. Like at a startup, you'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll have a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend.\n\nYou'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you're ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.\n\nFor Example, We Currently Use\n\nWith Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly. We often face entirely novel problems, so solving them may require expanding your skillset.\n A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github\nAnd if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.\n\nA career as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could. As you rotate among teams, you'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, finance, and law enforcement. You'll learn from experts in these fields about their problems and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them. Questions that seem simple from the outside will quickly become complex as you consider the nuances and consequences of every possible answer.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies Python for data processing and analysis Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3\nOur Principles\n Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves. Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them. Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress.\nWhat We Value\n Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision Willingness and interest to travel as needed\nRequirements\n Security clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance\nIf you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, you may contact us at accommodations@palantir.com.\n ",

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.\n\nThe Role\n\nForward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” FDSEs lead the process of finding answers.\n\nAs an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. Like at a startup, you'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll have a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend.\n\nYou'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you're ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.\n\nFor Example, We Currently Use\n\nWith Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly. We often face entirely novel problems, so solving them may require expanding your skillset.\n A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github\nAnd if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.\n\nA career as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could. As you rotate among teams, you'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, finance, and law enforcement. You'll learn from experts in these fields about their problems and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them. Questions that seem simple from the outside will quickly become complex as you consider the nuances and consequences of every possible answer.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies Python for data processing and analysis Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3\nOur Principles\n Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves. Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them. Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress.\nWhat We Value\n Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision Willingness and interest to travel as needed\nRequirements\n Security clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance\nIf you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, you may contact us at accommodations@palantir.com.\n ",

We value the desire to get hands-on and dive into the details of the data because that’s the core of our work. And we value empathy over ego, because the outcome matters more than who gets the credit.Excellent ability to take on open-ended problems in unstructured environments.Adaptive and introspective; willing to learn, teach, lead and follow.Ability to travel 25 – 75% required.

            "post_html_body": "\nA World-Changing Company\n\nAt Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.\n\nThe Role\n\nThe Palantir Design Team is responsible for the human experience of using our software. Our team is growing rapidly, but we're committed to creating a tight-knit team environment that fosters trust, integrity, empathy, and growth. We work together in realizing a shared product vision, and regularly give feedback and critique to each other.\n\nDesigning at Palantir is a varied experience. On a given day, you might be: leading a design sprint for your product team; designing a micro-interaction to make a complex analytical task feel simple; and/or advocating for UX consistency by creating flexible, reusable UI components.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\n Interaction and visual design. As a product designer, you'll be involved at every stage of design work. You'll help define early product concepts, flesh out the high-level workflow and micro-interactions of a feature, and execute on a crisp and effective visual design. You should have experience with some of the following mockup and prototyping tools: Sketch, Framer, Principle, Figma, Invision.\n\n User research. We frequently do informal user research, and value people who can be flexible with research processes and methodologies to achieve the right outcome. You'll often visit customer offices to interview and learn from the users we serve. You'll pair qualitative methods (e.g. scripted usability tests and contextual inquiry) with quantitative information, like product and usage metrics.\n\n Prototyping. You will prototype—using software like Principle and Framer, or another favorite method—both to communicate your designs and validate your decisions.\n\n Partnering with engineers. We work closely with product and forward deployed engineers to realize our design ideas. You'll treat engineers as partners and collaborate with them to prototype and build out products.\n\n Awareness of how software interfaces are built. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript is appreciated. You don't need to be an expert—just fluent enough to collaborate with engineers, and know what's possible with frontend technologies. Resources and mentorship are available to designers who want to learn more.\n\nDesigners at Palantir have great autonomy over their work, so a wide skill set is necessary. However, many designers on the team are also passionate experts in one area. You might be the kind of designer who ships code every week, or the kind of designer who shares detailed user research findings with your team.\n\nWhat We Value\nAn iterative design process. You validate your ideas early (with stakeholders and users) and are thoughtful and intentional in seeking and responding to feedback. You move fast, listen, and adapt. You rapidly incorporate feedback, and prioritize collaboration. You are adept at giving and receiving critiques.Collaboration and communication. You can build great relationships with engineers, PMs, and other stakeholders—and convey your design rationale to them. To reach these audiences, you'll communicate your designs through a variety of methods: presenting your mockups, making prototypes, sharing a design spec.Thoughtful, intentional work. You know that form informs function and usability—that the surface layer doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Your design decisions are often informed by—and will influence—engineering and business considerations.Dedication to the user. You'll design software that changes how people use data in government, commercial, and philanthropic contexts. You strive to understand our users—who can range from a manufacturing plant worker to a pharmaceutical researcher—and fight to empower them.\n\nOur team has people from a variety of backgrounds—people who studied type design, computer science, psychology; people who joined Palantir right after university; and people who joined our team after switching industries. We value skills and mindset over a specific educational background.\n\nWhen You Apply\n\nIf parts of your portfolio are password-protected, please include your portfolio password under 'Additional Information' when applying.\n\nIf you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, you may contact us at accommodations@palantir.com .\n ",

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. What We're About At its core, the Deployment Strategist role centers around leveraging data in operational and real-world action. Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to protect their troops, manufacture high-quality products, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver aid to refugees safely is to make better use of their data. Deployment Strategists are responsible for turning that hunch into reality. If you believe in the transformative power of data and technology and in your own ability to bring that power to bear against complex problems, we want to meet you. What We Do As a Deployment Strategist, you'll work as part of a driven and creative team of Engineers, Product Designers, and other Deployment Strategists to deploy software against the most challenging problems our world faces. Your mission is to synthesize disconnected streams of thought into a cohesive understanding of what the most important problem is, what the data means, what the product needs, what users are motivated by, and where the impact could be. Deployment Strategists are do-ers who immerse themselves in our customers' most intricate workflows, partner with customer teams and explore the data, and dive into the product landscape to enable us to scale. A select number of Deployments Strategists may also be deployed to Palantir internal teams and problems. In this role, the problems you'll tackle will require a curious and analytical mindset, a sharp intuition for product, and a strong degree of user empathy to ultimately empower our customers to make better decisions. Core ResponsibilitiesGo onsite and meet with customer analysts to understand the critical questions they need to answer and locate their biggest pain points.Identify relevant datasets through deep engagement with customer problems and workflows, and work with Forward Deployed Engineers to integrate the data into a stable and extensible pipeline.Work with the customer to build bespoke workflows for new user groups.Lead training sessions to ensure that the product is meeting user needs, and to ensure it is being used widely enough to have concrete impact on our partners' operations.Present the results of our work and proposals for future work to audiences ranging from analysts to C-suite executives.Embed with our Software Engineering and Product Design teams to incorporate what you saw in the field into cross-Palantir product offerings.Build and deliver demos to new and existing customers.Scope out potential engagements in new industries and in increasingly expanding locations around the world. RequirementsWe value team members who aren't satisfied with \"what\" because they know \"why\" is the juicier question. We value the desire to get hands-on and dive into the details of the data because that's the core of our work. And we value empathy over ego, because the outcome matters more than who gets the credit.Excellent ability to take on open-ended problems in unstructured environments.Adaptive and introspective; willing to learn, teach, lead and follow.Ability to travel 25 - 75% required. Varies by location and team.Experience with programming, scripting or statistical packages (e.g. Python, R, Matlab, SQL) is a plus.

Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nOur small engineering team works on challenging problems every day. We have a culture that's rooted in constantly learning and improving, and our engineers are encouraged to think big and experiment with new ideas. Using continuous deployment, we quickly see our changes in the product and make fast iterations. Our engineers focus on creating polished products and writing high quality code by designing APIs and abstractions that are extensible and maintainable. Everyone on the engineering team has a huge impact on our product and our company.\n\nTo fully achieve our mission, we need to make sure that the knowledge on Quora will improve and last forever. Revenue from our monetization efforts plays a critical role in empowering us to do that. In just two years since we first launched our advertising platform, we've already grown to support thousands of advertisers who are reaching over 300 million monthly unique visitors on Quora. Our journey is just beginning as we continue to build new products from the ground up and tackle exciting challenges at scale. Today, we're working on a broad range of areas to support our data-intensive needs: metrics and insights reporting, audience targeting, low-latency real-time ad delivery, and a suite of advertiser tools to create and optimize campaigns, to name just a few.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nAt Quora, we use Machine Learning in various parts of the product - feed ranking, spam detection, topic and user recommendations, etc. Our team of Machine Learning Engineers and have high impact by advancing the current Machine Learning systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. You will also play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.\n\nResponsibilities\n Improve our existing Machine Learning systems using your expertise Identify new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to different parts of the Quora product Work with other engineers to implement algorithms and systems in an efficient way Take end-to-end ownership of Machine Learning systems -- from data pipelines and training, to realtime prediction engine.  Minimum Qualifications:\n B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Engineering or a related technical field Strong understanding of mathematical foundations of Machine Learning algorithms Knowledge of Python or C++, or the ability to learn them quickly A passion for learning and always improving yourself and the team around you  Preferred Qualifications:\n Previous software engineering experience via an internship, work experience or coding competition Passion for Quora's mission and goals \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. The Role The Palantir Design Team is responsible for the human experience of using our software. Our team is growing rapidly, but we're committed to creating a tight-knit team environment that fosters trust, integrity, empathy, and growth. We work together in realizing a shared product vision, and regularly give feedback and critique to each other. Designing at Palantir is a varied experience. On a given day, you might be: leading a design sprint for your product team; designing a micro-interaction to make a complex analytical task feel simple; and/or advocating for UX consistency by creating flexible, reusable UI components. Core Responsibilities Interaction and visual designAs a product designer, you'll be involved at every stage of design work. You'll help define early product concepts, flesh out the high-level workflow and micro-interactions of a feature, and execute on a crisp and effective visual design. You should have experience with some of the following mockup and prototyping tools: Sketch, Framer, Principle, Figma, Invision. User researchWe frequently do informal user research, and value people who can be flexible with research processes and methodologies to achieve the right outcome. You'll often visit customer offices to interview and learn from the users we serve. You'll pair qualitative methods (e.g. scripted usability tests and contextual inquiry) with quantitative information, like product and usage metrics. PrototypingYou will prototype-using software like Principle and Framer, or another favorite method-both to communicate your designs and validate your decisions. Partnering with engineersWe work closely with product and forward deployed engineers to realize our design ideas. You'll treat engineers as partners and collaborate with them to prototype and build out products. Awareness of how software interfaces are built. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript is appreciated. You don't need to be an expert-just fluent enough to collaborate with engineers, and know what's possible with frontend technologies. Resources and mentorship are available to designers who want to learn more. Designers at Palantir have great autonomy over their work, so a wide skill set is necessary. However, many designers on the team are also passionate experts in one area. You might be the kind of designer who ships code every week, or the kind of designer who shares detailed user research findings with your team. What We ValueAn iterative design process. You validate your ideas early (with stakeholders and users) and are thoughtful and intentional in seeking and responding to feedback. You move fast, listen, and adapt. You rapidly incorporate feedback, and prioritize collaboration. You are adept at giving and receiving critiques.Collaboration and communication. You can build great relationships with engineers, PMs, and other stakeholders-and convey your design rationale to them.

We organize and sort terabytes of data and develop solutions used by millions of users every single day. We design products that make sophisticated research simple. Engineering focuses on these tenets; Platform-oriented, API First, Secure, One Product (Our customers shouldn’t have to learn two different ways of solving the same problem), and Quality ( Our customers rely on our products to drive their businesses. Our software must work. If a feature is buggy, don’t release it (if it hasn’t been released yet), fix it or take it out.)\nQuality Engineering Challenge\nOur Quality Engineering organization’s mission is to build a quality culture championing a delightful customer experience while enabling teams to efficiently bring high quality software to all markets. We do this by engaging early to ensure customer use cases are tested AND fully automated. We also automate the release process to save human effort, reduce mistakes, and speed overall delivery.
